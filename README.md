pease is an extension to the [spock](http://spockframework.org/) framework
that adds support for acceptance test driven development (ATDD).

With pease you can use [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin/)
(known from [Cucumber](http://cukes.info)) to describe
how your software should behave and generate a spock test.
